              <h6>Another dessert not mentioned above that deserves recognition is the famous Creme Brulee. Below is the recipe to make this dessert.</h6>
                <p><em><strong>Step 1</em></strong><br>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 2</strong></em><br>Beat egg yolks, 4 tablespoons white sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until thick and creamy.<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 3</strong></em><br>Pour cream into a saucepan and stir over low heat until it almost comes to a boil. Remove the cream from heat immediately. Stir cream into the egg yolk mixture; beat until combined.<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 4</strong></em><br>Pour cream mixture into the top pan of a double boiler. Stir over simmering water until mixture lightly coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Remove mixture from heat immediately and pour into a shallow heat-proof dish.<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 5</strong></em><br>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 6</strong></em><br>Preheat oven to broil.<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 7</strong></em><br>In a small bowl combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of white sugar and brown sugar. Sift this mixture evenly over custard. Place dish under broiler until sugar melts, about 2 minutes. Watch carefully so as not to burn.<br>

                 <em><strong>Step 8</strong></em><br>Remove from heat and allow to cool. Refrigerate until custard is set again.<br>
