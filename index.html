                <li><strong>Carrot Cake</strong><br>What makes carrot cake so popular is a very different ingredient. This cake contains carrots which are in the name. This type of cake was invented during the middle ages by Europeans when it was hard to get ahold of certain ingredients so they had to come up with substitutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Cream</strong><br>The United States is the country that consumes the most ice cream with vanilla being the most popular flavor. Ice cream was first created in China about 200 B.C by using rice and milk mixtures and freezing it.</li>
